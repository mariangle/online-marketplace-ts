<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Introduction

Penpal is a full stack application designed to simulate the traditional experience of writing physical letters. It achieves this by incorporating delays in delivery time based on the geographical distance between users. The purpose of Penpal is to serve as a foundation for building a larger full stack application using the new Next.js app router. This expansion aims to enhance the application's API routes and responses, providing a more advanced user experience.

Here are some key features:

- [Text editing](#text-editing)
- [Mailbox](#mailbox)
- [Reviewing System](#reviewing-system)

### Text Editing

You can easily use the text editor that enables easy text formatting, image uploading and editing capabilities. Once your letter is sent, you will receive an estimated delivery time which will be based on the distance between you and the recipient.

### Mailbox

Your letters are organized into different categories: Inbox, Sent Letters, and Pending Letters. The categorization depends on the status of each letter.
